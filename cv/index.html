<!-- <h3>What I enjoy</h3> -->

<!-- <p>Reading, writing, programming.</p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   Developing, optimizing and taking care of sophisticated systems. Or -->
<!--   put another way: I like to program where the rubber hits the road — -->
<!--   wherever that may be. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   Deep diving into programming languages, interpreters, compilers, web servers, systems -->
<!--   programming, Unix, databases. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   I'm a big fan of digging deep and peeling -->
<!--   away at abstraction layers to get a better sense of what I'm working with -->
<!--   and more leverage higher up. In short: I love learning new things. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<!-- <h3>What I value</h3> -->
<!-- <p>Simplicity, minimalism, rawness, honesty, essence.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Humor. Humor isn't less important than seriousness.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Kindness, harmony, humbleness. There's always something to learn.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Discipline, craft, professionalism.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Curiosity, joy, beauty, improvements, change.</p> -->
