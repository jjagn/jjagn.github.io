              <p> This project involved making an animatronic version of one of Enztec's medical instruments for display at a trade show in the U.S. This came across my desk on a pretty tight timeline and involved electrical and mechanical design. Working within the context of a display device for a trade show brought with it an interesting set of requirements. Firstly, the emphasis on looking professional made getting power and motion to the upper portion of the instrument a challenge, as there were to be no visible wires between the instrument and the base. This involved fabricating a custom battery pack to fit in the handle, and using a tiny microcontroller to power the servo that moved the device's handle. The two halves of the display would also have to communicate to create realistic motion, and I didn't like the idea of having to guide someone in the U.S. through troubleshooting a wifi or bluetooth connection in a conference hall full of wireless signals while I was stuck back in N.Z. To get around this, a magnet in the 'cup' on the front is detected by a hall sensor in the body of the instrument when it moves close, and this allows the two halves of the display to sync their motion.
